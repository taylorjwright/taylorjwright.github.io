I'm a PhD candidate with the economics department at the University of Ottawa. I am an applied microeconomist and my research interests broadly fall under political economy, public economics, and law and economics. 

I'm on the 2021-2022 academic job market and am available for virtual interviews at EJME and around the ASSA and CEEE annual meetings, or by appointment.

I like coffee, Dungeons & Dragons, and grumbling about the Toronto Maple Leafs.
